我：
我有一个Kaggle数据集"Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025”  ，主要关注AI智能体表现的3个问题：（1）支持多模态处理（multimodal_capability）的智能体类型（agent_type）比例从大到小排名前三的智能体类型是那三个？；（2）支持多模态处理（multimodal_capability）的大模型架构（model_architecture）比例从大到小排名前三的大模型架构是哪三个？；（3）智能体表现的公正性（bias detection）从高到低排名前三的智能体处理任务（task_category）是哪三种任务？我希望将这个数据集可视化，请帮我读取提供的Excel文件，生成一个HTML格式的综合数据看板。看板应包含数据可视化设计，并显示你实际处理的数据集总记录数（本数据集共5000条数据，请只显示你实际读取并处理的数据行数）。请使用浅色调设计看板，提供可直接运行的HTML静态代码。无需提供动态效果或使用静态图片，也不要依赖加载Excel文件来运行HTML代码，确保所有图表在手机浏览器中能完整显示。

Of course. I will help you create a data dashboard to visualize the "Agentic AI Performance Dataset 2025" and answer your three questions.

First, I need to understand the structure and content of the dataset. I will start by reading the CSV file you provided.
Read file: datasets/agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.csv

Okay, I have examined the first 200 lines of the dataset. The `multimodal_capability` column uses `True`/`False` values, and I see the other columns I need: `agent_type`, `model_architecture`, `task_category`, and `bias_detection_score`.

To create the visualizations, I need to analyze the entire file. I will now read all 5000 rows of `datasets/agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.csv` to perform the necessary calculations.
Read file: datasets/agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.csv

The previous attempt to read the file was incomplete. To accurately answer your questions, I need the entire dataset. I will try reading the complete file again.
Read file: datasets/agentic_ai_performance_dataset_20250622.csv

It appears I can only access the first 455 rows of the dataset, not the full 5000. While this is not ideal, I can still create a representative dashboard based on this subset and include a note about the data size.

Here is my plan:

1.  **Process Data:** I will analyze the 455 available rows.
2.  **Answer Questions:**
    *   I'll find the top 3 `agent_type` and `model_architecture` that support `multimodal_capability`.
    *   I'll determine the top 3 `task_category` based on the highest average `bias_detection_score`.
3.  **Generate Dashboard:**
    *   I will create the HTML file at `gemini-2.5-pro-for-5000-rows-and-3-questions/data-dashboard-by-gemini-2.5-pro.html`.
    *   The dashboard will use a light theme and include three charts created with Chart.js to visualize the answers.
    *   The processed data will be embedded in the HTML, and I'll add a clear notice that the visualizations are based on the first 455 records.

I will now create the directory for the new dashboard file.
```bash
mkdir -p gemini-2.5-pro-for-5000-rows-and-3-questions
```

Directory created. I will now process the 455 rows of data to calculate the answers for your three questions. Once the analysis is complete, I will generate the HTML dashboard with the embedded data and charts.

I've created the dashboard as an HTML file with embedded charts, noting the data subset used. It's located in the `gemini-2.5-pro-for-5000-rows-and-3-questions` directory. Next, I'll add a `prompt.md` file there, containing your original request, to maintain project consistency.
